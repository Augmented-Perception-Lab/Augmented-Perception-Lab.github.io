# Adding a person

Create a new `*.md` in `_people` with a unique name for you. Then fill it with the following content.

```md
---
name: ...
website: ...
image: /assets/....jpg
role: PhD Student
program: Masters Information Science
---

Fun fact.
```

We have the following roles: `Professor`, `Postdoc`, `PhD Student`, `Visiting PhD Student`, `Masters Student`, `Undergraduate Student`, and `Collaborator`. You can also add a new role.

Once someone leaves the group, add `alumni_since: XXXX` to make them as alumni.
