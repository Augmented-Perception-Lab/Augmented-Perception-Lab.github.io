Do people behave similarly in Virtual Reality (VR) as in the real world? In this paper, we compare walking behavior and subjective experience in VR versus real environments. In an empirical study, 16 participants performed a way-point navigation task in a real environment and three virtual replicas while operating in the same physical environment. We varied the level of realism across the virtual replicas (3D scan, lower fidelity replica, and an abstract box-based representation). We measured walking trajectories and gait-related metrics, as well as participants' subjective ratings for comfort, workload, sense of embodiment, and spatial presence experience. Our results indicate that there are significant differences in both behavioral and self-reported measures between real and immersive conditions. While the specific virtual environment representation yielded differences in participants' subjective experiences, it did not affect participants' walking behavior in a significant manner. We conclude by discussing how VR applications can be designed to induce more realistic user behavior.
