Efficiently searching and navigating virtual scenes is essential for performing various downstream tasks and ensuring a positive user experience in VR. Prior VR interaction techniques for such scenarios predominantly rely on users' visual perception, which contrasts with physical reality, where people typically rely on multimodal information, especially auditory cues, to guide their spatial awareness. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging auditory interaction techniques to enhance spatial navigation in virtual environments. We drew inspiration from prior distant interaction techniques and developed four approaches to augmenting how users hear in the virtual environment: Audio Teleportation, Audio Cone, Ninja Ears, and Boom Mic. In a comparative user study ($N=25$), we evaluated these approaches against a baseline teleportation technique in a search task, where participants traversed a virtual environment to locate target items. Our results suggest that several of our audio interaction techniques may enable more efficient search behaviors while enhancing overall user experience. However, not all techniques were appreciated equally, suggesting that careful attention to their design is critical for ensuring their effectiveness. We conclude by discussing the potential implications of our results for future audio interaction technique designs.
